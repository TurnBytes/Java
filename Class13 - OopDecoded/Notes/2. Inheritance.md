Recall! What was the problem with PPP?

Inheritance: 
    Mechanism allowing a subclass (child) to inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class.
    superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from 
    subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class

    How: 
        Use the extends keyword to inherit from a parent class.
        Access Modifier: protected

    Multiple Inheritance: Scratch you head? Diamon Problme -Relax: You Just Rescued-> Using Interfaces

    Class, I Really Don't Want to be Inherited😢😢. You're at liberty to do what you want--use final keyword
    

    Benefits: 
        Promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship among classes. 

Let's get our hand dirty with some Awkward😁😁 Code

class Person {
    protected String name;
    protected int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void introduce() {
        System.out.println("Hi, I'm " + name + " and I'm " + age + " years old.");
    }
}
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
class Student extends Person {
    private String major;

    public Student(String name, int age, String major) {
        super(name, age); // Call to parent constructor
        this.major = major;
    }

    public void study() {
        System.out.println(name + " is studying " + major + ".");
    }
}

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
class Teacher extends Person {
    private String subject;

    public Teacher(String name, int age, String subject) {
        super(name, age); // Call to parent constructor
        this.subject = subject;
    }

    public void teach() {
        System.out.println(name + " teaches " + subject + ".");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating Student and Teacher objects
        Student s = new Student("Ali", 20, "Computer Science");
        Teacher t = new Teacher("Dr. Fatima", 45, "Mathematics");

        // Using inherited and subclass methods
        s.introduce();
        s.study();

        t.introduce();
        t.teach();
    }
}
