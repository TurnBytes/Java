### Abstract Class vs Interface: Key Differences

Here are the key differences between abstract classes and interfaces in Java, explained in a structured format:


#### **1. Methods**
- **Abstract Class**: Can have both abstract methods (without a body) and concrete methods (with an implementation OR body).
- **Interface (Prior to Java 8)**: Can only have abstract methods / method signature without a body.
- **Interface (Java 8 and Later)**: Can have abstract methods, default methods (methods with a body), and static methods.

#### **2. Instance Variables**
- **Abstract Class**: Can have instance variables without any intialization.
- **Interface**: Cannot have instance variables, only static variables with initialization.

#### **3. Constructors**
- **Abstract Class**: Can have constructors to initialize instance variables or perform setup tasks.
- **Interface**: Cannot have constructors.

#### **4. Inheritance**
- **Abstract Class**: Supports single inheritance (a class can extend only one abstract class).
- **Interface**: Supports multiple inheritance (a class can implement multiple interfaces).

#### **5. Access Modifiers for Methods**
- **Abstract Class**: Methods can have any access modifier (e.g., `public`, `protected`, `private`).
- **Interface (Prior to Java 8)**: All methods are implicitly `public abstract`.
- **Interface (Java 8 and Later)**: Default and static methods can have bodies and are explicitly marked as `default` or `static`.

#### **6. Static Methods**
- **Abstract Class**: Can have static methods.
- **Interface (Prior to Java 8)**: Cannot have static methods.
- **Interface (Java 8 and Later)**: Can have static methods.

#### **7. Default Methods**
- **Abstract Class**: Not allowed.
- **Interface (Prior to Java 8)**: Not allowed.
- **Interface (Java 8 and Later)**: Allowed (introduced in Java 8).

#### **8. Purpose**
- **Abstract Class**: Used to define a common base class with shared functionality and enforce method implementation in subclasses.
- **Interface**: Used to define a contract for behavior that implementing classes must follow. Interfaces are ideal for achieving multiple inheritance and defining unrelated behaviors.

### Summary: Remember Protocol?
- Use **abstract classes** when you need to share code (e.g., concrete methods or instance variables) among related classes.
- Use **interfaces** when you need to define a contract for unrelated classes or achieve multiple inheritance.
