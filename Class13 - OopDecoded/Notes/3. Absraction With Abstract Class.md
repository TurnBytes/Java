### Key Points about Abstract Classes in Java:

1. **Abstract Class**: 
   - An abstract class can contain both abstract methods (methods without a body) / method signatures and concrete methods (methods with an implementation).
   - Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.

2. **Abstract Methods**:
   - These are methods declared without an implementation (no method body).
   - Any class extending an abstract class must provide implementations for all its abstract methods unless the subclass is also declared abstract.

3. **Concrete Methods in Abstract Classes**:
   - Abstract classes can also have concrete methods, which can be inherited by subclasses.

4. **Purpose**:
   - Abstract classes are used to define a common base for subclasses, enforcing a contract for certain methods while allowing shared functionality through concrete methods.

5. **Key Difference from Interfaces**:
   - Unlike interfaces, abstract classes can have instance variables and constructors.
   - Abstract classes support method implementations, while interfaces (prior to Java 8) only allowed method declarations.

6. **Usage**:
   - Use abstract classes when you want to provide a common base with shared functionality and enforce method implementation in subclasses.


7. **Get your Hands Dirty with some Awkwardüòâüòè Implementation**

abstract class Vehicle {
    protected String brand;

    public Vehicle(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    // Abstract method (must be implemented by child)
    public abstract void start();

    // Concrete method
    public void fuelStatus() {
        System.out.println(brand + " fuel is full.");
    }
}
//-------------------------------------------------------------
class Car extends Vehicle {
    public Car(String brand) {
        super(brand);
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println(brand + " car starts with a key.");
    }
}
//--------------------------------------------------------------
class Bike extends Vehicle {
    public Bike(String brand) {
        super(brand);
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println(brand + " bike starts with a kick.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v1 = new Car("Toyota");
        Vehicle v2 = new Bike("Honda");

        v1.start();       // abstract method
        v1.fuelStatus();  // concrete method

        v2.start();
        v2.fuelStatus();
    }
}
