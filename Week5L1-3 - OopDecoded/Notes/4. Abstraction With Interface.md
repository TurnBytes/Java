### Key Points about Interfaces in Java:
0. **Sort of Protocol** that declares behaviour classes must implement.

1. **Interface**:
   - An interface is a reference type (refers to a type that points to an object in memory rather than directly holding the data /object itself) in Java, similar to a class, that can contain only abstract methods (prior to Java 8) and static or final variables.
   - Starting from Java 8, interfaces can also have default methods (methods with a body) and static methods.
   - Interfaces cannot have constructors or instance variables.

2. **Purpose**:
   - Interfaces are used to achieve complete abstraction and define a contract that implementing classes must follow.
   - They are ideal for defining behaviors that multiple classes can implement.

3. **Key Differences from Abstract Classes**:
   - Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods, while interfaces (prior to Java 8) only allowed abstract methods.
   - Abstract classes can have instance variables and constructors, whereas interfaces cannot.
   - A class can extend only one abstract class (single inheritance), but it can implement multiple interfaces (multiple inheritance).

4. **Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces**:
   - Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity (e.g., the diamond problem).
   - Interfaces allow multiple inheritance because a class can implement multiple interfaces. This is possible because interfaces only define method signatures, and there is no ambiguity in method implementation.

5. **Default and Static Methods in Interfaces (Java 8 and Later)**:
   - **Default Methods**: These are methods with a body in an interface. They allow interfaces to provide a default implementation for methods.
     ```java
     interface Vehicle {
         default void start() {
             System.out.println("Vehicle is starting...");
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Static Methods**: These are methods that belong to the interface itself and cannot be overridden by implementing classes.
     ```java
     interface Vehicle {
         static void service() {
             System.out.println("Vehicle service in progress...");
         }
     }
     ```

6. **Functional Interfaces**:
   - A functional interface is an interface with exactly one abstract method. These are used extensively in lambda expressions and functional programming.
   - Example: `Runnable`, `Callable`, `Comparator`.

7. **Example Implementation**:
   ```java
   interface Vehicle {
       void start(); // Abstract method
       void stop();  // Abstract method
   }

   interface Electric {
       void charge(); // Abstract method
   }

   class Car implements Vehicle, Electric {
       public void start() {
           System.out.println("Car starts with a key.");
       }

       public void stop() {
           System.out.println("Car stops with brakes.");
       }

       public void charge() {
           System.out.println("Car is charging.");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Car myCar = new Car();
           myCar.start();
           myCar.charge();
           myCar.stop();
       }
   }
