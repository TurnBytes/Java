Encapsulation: Remember, what was wrong with PP?
    -1 Encapsulation is when you wrap up your data under a single unit
    -2 Restricting Access to sensitive data / hidding sensitive daat 
    -3 Providing control Access using setter and getter methods
        OR: 
            Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a single unit (object/class) and restricting direct access to its internal state. 
                    

Achieving Encapsulation:
    -1 Declare class variables/attributes as private.
    -2 Provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable.

public class BankAccount {
    private String accountHolder;  // Private fields
    private double balance;

    // Constructor
    public BankAccount(String accountHolder, double initialBalance) {
        this.accountHolder = accountHolder;
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Getter
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Setter with validation || million wyas to validate 
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposited: $" + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid deposit amount");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("John Doe", 1000);
        account.deposit(500);//change this amount to -2 etc to see the result
        System.out.println("Current Balance: $" + account.getBalance());
    }
}
